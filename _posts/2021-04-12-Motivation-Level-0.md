# Elephant in the room

Yep, motivation to work on any projects has been at a very low level recently. Wanted to give it a -ve score if possible, but that would just mean motivation to do something bad and thats not whats happening so whaterver I guess.

# Countermeasures

Now I'm planning to just be stuck at the library I guess. That would be the best way to counter the negative emotions that have been welling up inside of me.

I'm in the library at the moment, typing this from the library. Gonna be stuck here till dinner time I guess.

Wanted to add a pic of the library but not sure if I wanna take a pic when there are so many people around.

Well, this is just my first test post from the library to check the internet connectivity and everything.

:wq
