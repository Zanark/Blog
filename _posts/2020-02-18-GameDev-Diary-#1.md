# GameDev Diary #1

I wanted to learn C#, and whats the best way to learn C# other than making Games and stuff.

I started with MonoGame just like how a friend suggested, however I just cant bring up the motivation
to sit and work on it right now. Honestly, I have no idea where did all of my creative will vanish off to.
However, now I have some idea as to where I can start from.

I read [this article](https://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2013/08/01/Just-starting-out-what-games-should-I-make.aspx) written by the [Youtuber GamesFromScratch (check him out, he's awesome)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr-5TdGkKszdbboXXsFZJTQ) and realised something.

I cannot make a RPG games as a beginner, even though I have some programming language experience, I CANNOT!
NO ONE CAN! IT WIL TAKE TIME!

I just don't know why I was unable to understand something so obvious.


Now I really dont wanna waste anymore time. Imma start today!
