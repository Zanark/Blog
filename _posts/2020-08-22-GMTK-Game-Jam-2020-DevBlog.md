You are waiting for the video to premier on youtube which reveals the theme.
You are really excited and bang your head like a Tarsier Monkey.
Then Mark tells the theme and then the rest of the video's background fads to audio
while you look at the screen with a face that says
"What the Fuck?"

5:00
Though ya I'll admit the theme was pretty unique and when I heard the theme for the first time,
the only thing that came to my mid was 'an infection out of control'

YouTube: looks at you(shows the two finger "I have my eyes on you" thing)
me: I didnt even say the word

Anyways...
So you see an infection in the computer world will be called a malware
and whats the most anoying type of malware?

(random popups start coming on the screen....the screen gets floded with them)
yep...adware

### Day 1

So I sat down and started noting down whatever came to mind.

[Read out the blueprint]

Then I realised, antiviruses nowadays are good enough to easily disable an adware.
So I switched to the 90s

zoom out
Me: [Shouting] I said so I switched to the 90s

you glitch and now you have a 90s computer geek outfit on you

See, there were two reasosn why i switched to  Win98 style graphics

- I'll get an excuse for the adware being out of control cuz weak antivirus
- The old operating systems had this pixelated UI and I always prefer pixel art when
creating a game for a jam cuz game jams are usually very short and pixel art does not take
too long to make.

So once I was done brainstorming, it was time to make some rough sketches

I drew a basic draft of how I wanted every game screen to look and how the gameplay
would progress

[Show the Visual Blueprint and explain]

(Slideshow of the art made on day 1)
I then created the art for the game, as you can see its some basic pixel art with a Win16 palette that
comes preloaded in aseprite

Now that I was done with the art, I started designing a few prototypes that I could send to some of my friends for some feedback and called it a day.

### Day 2

New day and with some fresh coffee(instant tho) and a fresh mind I was ready to get back to working
on my game.
Turns out my friends kinda liked the UI, and one of 'em asked me to use a UI toolkit cuz that'd be better
however I wanted to go the self made assets way for this so I just made everything on aseprite, which took a while but I'm glad I chose to make it from scratch cuz this helped me learn how I can make buttons look like buttons in aseprite.

With the OS UI done, it was time to work on the coding part of the game, and boi am I a noob in GDScript.

For those who don't know, I use the Godot Engine for game development and GDScript is the native language used by godot which is kinda similar to Python, it works well on Linux so I find it more comfortable.

Okay back to coding, I first started working on the buttons and other triggers for the game so that the transitions to different scenes will get smoother and after that I tried to work on the random adware pop up.

Well window popups in Godot come under the Control node and i'm not good at working with control nodes yet. So this took a long time and ate up the remaining time of day 2. But in the end I was able to get it work the way I wanted it to so I'm happy? I'll dive into control nodes again when I get the time.

So with the adware pop ups done, I then set up the title and end screen for the game and a tutorial for the players cuz my gameplay wasnt as structured and as smooth as I wanted it to be.

WIth everything done, I set up an itch.io page fo rthe game and submitted it for the game jam

[Record video of start screen, end screen and the itch io page]

(fade out to turbo reviewing your game)
Game review by Turbo:

### End Card

Thanx a ton Johnny Turbo for reviewing my game, check his channel out, he has some really good videos about game dev and how game dev works in the corporate world.

Thanx a ton to everyone who checked out my game and rated it for the jam.

So I'll see ya'all again, goodbye and keep learning new stuff.
