# Quick Catchup

Hi everyone! I wish everyone a Happy New Year! :D

Its been a really ong time since I last uploaded a post on this blog. Not gonna lie, I've been pretty lazy. However! It all changes starting today!

*My New Year Resolution:*	Journal or Blog everyday (write something everyday to be exact)

This will help me keep myself accountable and improve my English and story writing skills for game development, oh and yeah, my typing speed.

Cheers to a year of productivity. Guess my theme is *Creativity* this year.

now back to the Book Review

## Judging the book by its cover

Well the cover looks great, the combination of mandarin orange and white looks really good. Gives me the vibes of a sunrise :P

## Chapter 1 to 8

Chapters 1 to 8 are more like a prologue to the whole book. If you want to dive directly into the meat of the book then you'll have to start from Chapter 9 where the author actually starts talking about the steps you can take every morning to Own your Morning, Elevate your Life.

## Chapter 9
