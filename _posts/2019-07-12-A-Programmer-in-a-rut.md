# A Programmer stuck in a rut.

It doesn't matter how successfull you are or how hard-working you are or how easily you can get motivated to do someting, eventually you'll reach a point in your life where you'll start loosing interest in everything. You'll start feeling comfirtable with not challenging yourself anymore. You won't be able to bring up the desire to take an action.
