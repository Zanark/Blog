# A Programmer stuck in a rut.

It doesn't matter how successfull you are or how hard-working you are or how easily you can get motivated to do someting, eventually you'll reach a point in your life where you'll start loosing interest in everything. You'll start feeling comfortable with not challenging yourself anymore. You won't be able to get inspired and motivated from any new challenges. You won't be able to bring up the desire to take an action.

The thing that rendered you useless can be anything, it can be a bug which you're just unable to rectify, it can be a badly documented API, or maybe its because you are a JAVA Programmer.

It can actually come also after success as well, maybe you're starting to feel less motivated while solving even the most challenging questions, maybe you are feeling comfortable with the status of your app and dont want to add any new features to ruin its simplicity.

So if you can relate to anything close to what I mentioned above then you might be in a rut and its totally okay. Trust me it happens to the best of us.

I wanted to give you some of the best tips that I've learned from other people to et yourself out of it.

### 1. Start Small

When in a rut, you just dont feel like doing anything, like anything at all. Even the thought of a small task like setting up your bed can exhaust you and make you feel unmotivated instantly.

So instead of looking at the as a whole, break 'em down to smaller tasks that you can complete quickly. This gives you a small shot of motivation and that sweet lil dope-a-mine.

Starting small is the key, you can then slowly combine everything and finish that task which was daunting on you without getting exhausted.
