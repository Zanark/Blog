![C# .NET Tutorial series Thumbail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zanark/Blog/master/media/CNET%20Thumb.png)

So I've started a new series on my YouTube channel - C# and .NET Tutorial Series.

Its kind of like a video journal that keeps track of my progress.

The link to the [Video](https://youtu.be/uLdNytpAIcI)

I'm going to upload all the code to this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Zanark/L-NET/)

I'll try my best to upload 1 video every 2 days, I hope I'll be able to actually do that.
