So I've started a new series on my YouTube channel - C# and .NET Tutorial Series.

Its kind of like a video journal that keeps track of my progress.

The link to the video: https://youtu.be/uLdNytpAIcI

I'm going to upload all the code to the following GitHub repo

Repository: https://github.com/Zanark/L-NET/

I'll try my best to upload 1 video every 2 days, I hope I'll be able to actually do that.
