## ROUND 0 - Written Exam

The exam was held on 19th June and the reporting time was 1PM.

Now let's just skip to the meat(panner if you are a vegetarian), the exam.

The Exam was held on mettl, and it had 4 sections.

| **Section** | **Alloted Time** |
| :------ | :---------- |
| Section 1 : Analytical and Quantitative -- 20 Questions | 20 Minutes |
| Section 2 : Hands on Programming -- 2 Questions | 25 Minutes |
| Section 3 : Tech MCQ -- 20 Questions | 20 Minutes |
| Section 4 : Written English Test  : 1 Question | 20 Minutes |

### Section 1 : Analytical and Quantitative

- Relative Directional Questions
- Complete a pattern
- Some Basic Maths

### Section 2 : Hands on Programmin

2 basic programming puzzle questions where you'll have to use diffrent data structures and algorithms to get the final result.

Clearing the hiddent test cases is the key to clearing this round

### Section 3 : Tech MCQ

DBMS, OS, and other theory based questions.
It had some networking questions as well. Many people struggled here, but people who have been studying subjects out of the syllabus of the current semester were able to crack it(basically people who go to GATE or any other coaching classes).

### Section 4 : Written English Test

Here we were given a topic to write an essay on.
The topic I got was - *The effect of media on one's social development*

<br><br>


The results of the written exam were declared on 22nd June, and luckily I was able to clear the written exam.

We were then asked to get ready for the Technical Interview which was going to be held on 24th June, yep, we had only 2 days to prepare for the interview.

After 2 days of preparation, THE DAY came.

In my defence, I was **REALLY** nervous. So if you saw me chowing down on chocalates and acting all goofy, I was basically trying to calm myself down with dopamine.

## ROUND 1 - The Technical Interview

This round consisted of a one-on-one interview with one of the panel members.

The pannel member asked for my Resume and briefly went through it.

He then asked me one of the most feared questions: *"Tell me more about yourself"*

Honestly, at first I was dumbfounded because I honestly wasn't expecting that question in a technical round.
