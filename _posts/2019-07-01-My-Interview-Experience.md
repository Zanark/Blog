## ROUND 0 - Written Exam

The exam was held on 19th June and the reporting time was 1PM.

Now let's just skip to the meat(panner if you are a vegetarian), the exam.

The Exam was held on mettl, and it had 4 sections.

| **Section** | **Alloted Time** |
| :------ | :---------- |
| Section 1 : Analytical and Quantitative -- 20 Questions | 20 Minutes |
| Section 2 : Hands on Programming -- 2 Questions | 25 Minutes |
| Section 3 : Tech MCQ -- 20 Questions | 20 Minutes |
| Section 4 : Written English Test  : 1 Question | 20 Minutes |

### Section 1 : Analytical and Quantitative

- Relative Directional Questions
- Complete a pattern
- Some Basic Maths

### Section 2 : Hands on Programmin

2 basic programming puzzle questions where you'll have to use diffrent data structures and algorithms to get the final result.

Clearing the hiddent test cases is the key to clearing this round

### Section 3 : Tech MCQ

DBMS, OS, and other theory based questions.
It had some networking questions as well. Many people struggled here, but people who have been studying subjects out of the syllabus of the current semester were able to crack it(basically people who go to GATE or any other coaching classes).

### Section 4 : Written English Test

Here we were given a topic to write an essay on.
The topic I got was - *The effect of media on one's social development*

<br><br>


The results of the written exam were declared on 22nd June, and luckily I was able to clear the written exam.

We were then asked to get ready for the Technical Interview which was going to be held on 24th June, yep, we had only 2 days to prepare for the interview.

After 2 days of preparation, THE DAY came.

In my defence, I was **REALLY** nervous. So if you saw me chowing down on chocalates and acting all goofy, I was basically trying to calm myself down with dopamine.
<br>

## ROUND 1 - The Technical Interview

This round consisted of a one-on-one interview with one of the panel members.

The pannel member asked for my Resume and briefly went through it.
<br>
He then asked me one of the most feared questions: *" Tell me more about yourself "*. Honestly, at first I was dumbfounded because I honestly wasn't expecting that question in a technical round. I told him about my background and about all of my projects and the experience I gained in my internships.

I then started talking about my GitHub profile and about the open source projects that I've contributed to. He then checked my GitHub profile and my pinned repositories.

After all the introductions, he gave me some simple math problems to solve.

    A friendly tip: BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT, its okay to be nervous, so take your time and calm down and solve the problem.

You can find such math problems on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/company-interview-corner/) or on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and practice there.

I'll admit that I was pretty nervous and it took me longer than expected to solve the questions, and the interviewer was also very friendly and provided me with some hints for which I respect him a lot.

After discussing a bit more about my projects he asked me questions from Computer Science Fundamentals, like:

- Operating Systems
- OOPs Concepts
- DBMS
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Time Complexity and Space Complexity

He also asked me to code some Dynamic Programming Algorithms. I wasn't able to answer all of the questions, but was able to give an outline of the approach one will take to solve the problems.

And that's it, I thanked the interviewer and headed back to the waiting room to join my peers banging their heads on the wall.<br>
I too was really dissapointed in myself for not being able to solve some of the basic questions.

## ROUND 2 - The Personal Interview

When I heard that I got selected for Round 2, I honestly couldn't believe it. I tried my best to hold my racing heart and the excitement in and took deep breaths to calm myself down and then headed for the interview.

I entred the interviewer's cabin, greeted her and took a seat.<br>
She asked me for my Resume and told me that she was pretty impressed from my GitHub profile.<br>
I honestly cannot express how glad I was for mentioning my GitHub profile on my Resume and during the interview.

    So remember kids, your GitHub profile is your second Resume.

We then started talking about my experiences while developing the projects(both good and bad), internship experiences(both good and bad), my hobbies and interests, my weaknessess and how I keep myself updated in this everchanging world of technology.

She also asked me some Client-Consultant scenario questions, as to how I'll solve a problem reported by a client and how I'll keep the client updated on the progress.
