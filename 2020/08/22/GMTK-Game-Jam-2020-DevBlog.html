<p>April 30 2020</p>

<p>Animation of you getting a notification from YouTube app that 
Mark just released a video
You click on the video</p>

<p>01:00 - 01:08
GMTK Game Jam Trailer</p>

<p>01:08 - 01:15
confetti</p>

<p>01:15 - 3:00
Explain what GMTK channel is, ask ‘em to check it out, 
and tell em about the history of gmtk jam.</p>

<p>3:00 - 5:00
You are waiting for the video to premier on youtube which reveals the theme.
You are really excited and bang your head like a Tarsier Monkey.
Then Mark tells the theme and then the rest of the video’s background fads to audio
while you look at the screen with a face that says
“What the Fuck?”</p>

<p>5:00
Though ya I’ll admit the theme was pretty unique and when I heard the theme for the first time,
the only thing that came to my mid was ‘an infection out of control’</p>

<p>YouTube: looks at you(shows the two finger “I have my eyes on you” thing)
me: I didnt even say the word</p>

<p>Anyways…
So you see an infection in the computer world will be called a malware
and whats the most anoying type of malware?</p>

<p>(random popups start coming on the screen….the screen gets floded with them)
yep…adware</p>

<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>

<p>So I sat down and started noting down whatever came to mind.</p>

<p>[Read out the blueprint]</p>

<p>Then I realised, antiviruses nowadays are good enough to easily disable an adware.
So I switched to the 90s</p>

<p>zoom out
Me: [Shouting] I said so I switched to the 90s</p>

<p>you glitch and now you have a 90s computer geek outfit on you</p>

<p>See, there were two reasosn why i switched to  Win98 style graphics</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ll get an excuse for the adware being out of control cuz weak antivirus</li>
  <li>The old operating systems had this pixelated UI and I always prefer pixel art when
creating a game for a jam cuz game jams are usually very short and pixel art does not take
too long to make.</li>
</ul>

<p>So once I was done brainstorming, it was time to make some rough sketches</p>

<p>I drew a basic draft of how I wanted every game screen to look and how the gameplay
would progress</p>

<p>[Show the Visual Blueprint and explain]</p>

<p>(Slideshow of the art made on day 1)
I then created the art for the game, as you can see its some basic pixel art with a Win16 palette that
comes preloaded in aseprite</p>

<p>Now that I was done with the art, I started designing a few prototypes that I could send to some of my friends for some feedback and called it a day.</p>

<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>

<p>New day and with some fresh coffee(instant tho) and a fresh mind I was ready to get back to working
on my game.
Turns out my friends kinda liked the UI, and one of ‘em asked me to use a UI toolkit cuz that’d be better
however I wanted to go the self made assets way for this so I just made everything on aseprite, which took a while but I’m glad I chose to make it from scratch cuz this helped me learn how I can make buttons look like buttons in aseprite.</p>

<p>With the OS UI done, it was time to work on the coding part of the game, and boi am I a noob in GDScript.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, I use the Godot Engine for game development and GDScript is the native language used by godot which is kinda similar to Python, it works well on Linux so I find it more comfortable.</p>

<p>Okay back to coding, I first started working on the buttons and other triggers for the game so that the transitions to different scenes will get smoother and after that I tried to work on the random adware pop up.</p>

<p>Well window popups in Godot come under the Control node and i’m not good at working with control nodes yet. So this took a long time and ate up the remaining time of day 2. But in the end I was able to get it work the way I wanted it to so I’m happy? I’ll dive into control nodes again when I get the time.</p>

<p>So with the adware pop ups done, I then set up the title and end screen for the game and a tutorial for the players cuz my gameplay wasnt as structured and as smooth as I wanted it to be.</p>

<p>WIth everything done, I set up an itch.io page fo rthe game and submitted it for the game jam</p>

<p>[Record video of start screen, end screen and the itch io page]</p>

<p>(fade out to turbo reviewing your game)
Game review by Turbo:</p>

<h3 id="end-card">End Card</h3>

<p>Thanx a ton Johnny Turbo for reviewing my game, check his channel out, he has some really good videos about game dev and how game dev works in the corporate world.</p>

<p>Thanx a ton to everyone who checked out my game and rated it for the jam.</p>

<p>So I’ll see ya’all again, goodbye and keep learning new stuff.</p>
